[
The minotaur does something similar to you over several turns that the gargoyle does in 1, but I think is probably ok for the gargoyle to do because:
- she is a third level npc, not a first level npc (even if that npc is a boss)
- she can't do this until she gains at least 3 difficulty, which means she has to blow the player and make them cum at least 3 times first.
- she isn't directly fucking you.
- she loses some health and potentially leaves the fight if she fails.
- Even if she succeeds, she will definitely go somewhere else after she's done holding you down.
- this is prevented with certain clothing, which are more specific than the requirements for avoiding the minotaur's version, but she isn't specifically checking for exposed orifices, which means the player may still have a lifeline.
