Swimming Pool by Objects begins here.

The swimming-pool is a water-body-scenery. the swimming-pool is not portable. The printed name of swimming-pool is "[TQlink of item described]swimming pool[shortcut-desc][TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]". The text-shortcut of swimming-pool is "swp". swimming-pool is in School20. Understand "swimming", "pool", "swimming pool" as swimming-pool.

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - swimming-pool):
	if diaper quest is 0, decide on Figure of school swimming pool cum;
	decide on Figure of school swimming pool.

To say ExamineDesc of (S - swimming-pool):
	if diaper quest is 0, say "This swimming pool isn't full of water, but instead strong-smelling warm [semen].[line break][variable custom style][if the semen taste addiction of the player < 10 and the semen addiction of the player < 10]What the FUCK is this place?![otherwise]That's... impressive...[end if][roman type][line break]";
	otherwise say "This swimming pool is complete with diving board and that familiar chlorine smell.".

Check showering water-body when swimming-pool is in the location of the player:
	if auto is 0 and diaper quest is 0:
		say "That's not full of water, but [semen]. Are you sure? ";
		unless the player is bimbo consenting, do nothing instead.

To say ShortDesc of (S - swimming-pool):
	say "swimming pool".

To say MediumDesc of (S - swimming-pool):
	say "swimming pool[if diaper quest is 0] full of [semen][end if]".

To compute swimming in (S - swimming-pool):
	if diaper quest is 0:
		compute TQ swimmingpool swimming at 0 with 0;
	otherwise:
		compute DQ swimmingpool swimming at 0 with 0;

[During the lesson, the pool has 10 different "locations". That's a lot, so we'll cut it down to 5 for the normal swimming: shallow, medium1, medium2, deep1, deep2(under the diving board)]
