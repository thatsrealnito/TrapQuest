Doom by Every Turn begins here.

[!<doomCounter:Integer>*

Ticks up once per mindless cultist per turn, as they perform the ritual. Other things such as the purity of the sacred-pool can also influence increase rate.

*!]
doom counter is a number that varies.

[!<doomed:Integer>*

Increases once every time doom counter reaches a multiple of 150. At each stage, certain elements of the game might be affected, new NPCs might be able to spawn, etc.
At doomed 4, the pink sphere appears
At doomed 5, the herald appears and mindless cultists become hostile

*!]
doomed is a number that varies.

[!<new-acolyte-counter:Integer>*

Increases once per turn. At 300 (might change), resets and a new mindless cultist joins the ritual.
