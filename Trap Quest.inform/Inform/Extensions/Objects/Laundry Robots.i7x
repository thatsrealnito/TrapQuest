Laundry Robots by Objects begins here.

laundry robots is a thing. laundry robots is not portable. laundry robots is in Hotel20. The printed name of laundry robots is "[TQlink of item described]robotic arms[TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]". Understand "robot", "robotic", "metal", "arms", "hands", "room" as laundry robots. laundry robots has a number called charge. The text-shortcut of laundry robots is "rarm".

To say ExamineDesc of (C - laundry robots):
	say "Several extremely agile metal robotic arms with threatening looking grippers at the end. They are constantly zipping about the place with unclear purpose.".

Report going when the player is in Hotel20:
	if the player is upright:
		compute LaundryRobots;
	otherwise if the number of worn washable clothing > 0:
		say "Having entered this room on your knees, it would appear that the mechanical arms above you have not detected you.".

To compute LaundryRobots:
	let C be a random worn washable clothing;
	if there is a worn messed knickers, now C is a random worn knickers;
	if C is clothing, say "As soon as you [if the player is upright]step over the threshold into this room[otherwise]are released[end if], several metal robotic arms shoot at you from every direction! Four robotic hands grab hold of each of your limbs respectively, rendering you immobile. ";
	if C is messed knickers:
		say "You yelp [if the bimbo of the player < 10][one of]in surprise[or]in frustration[stopping][otherwise]quietly[end if] as your entire body is picked up, carried over and dunked into a large hot vat of soapy water. The arms unceremoniously strip you of your [C] as you are repeatedly thrust into and out of the bubbly pool. Finally, you are dropped back down onto the ground, now dripping with water and suds. ";
		repeat with F running through worn fluid vulnerable clothing:
			clean F;
			Drench F;
			if F is knickers, WaterEmpty F;
		say "[one of]You think it's over, but before[or]Before[stopping] letting you go, the robotic arms silently force a new dry [ShortDesc of C] onto your crotch.[line break][variable custom style][if the bimbo of the player < 6 and C is a diaper]Why did they have to put me into another one?! Ugh.[otherwise if the bimbo of the player < 12]Well I'm glad that's over and done with.[otherwise]Thank you for changing me, nice robots![end if][roman type][line break]";
		now the charge of laundry robots is 200;
	otherwise if C is clothing and the charge of laundry robots <= 0:
		say "You watch [if the bimbo of the player < 10][one of]in surprise[or]in frustration[stopping][otherwise]in awe[end if] as your [C] is deftly pulled off you and speedily dunked into a large vat of hot soapy water. ";
		clean C;
		Drench C;
		now C is in the location of the player;
		say "Before you can blink, your [MediumDesc of C] is placed on a small table next to you.[line break][variable custom style][one of]Wow, now that is fast service.[or][if the bimbo of the player < 13]Nice.[otherwise]Thank you nice robots![end if][stopping][roman type][line break]";
		now the charge of laundry robots is 200;
	otherwise:
		say "The robotic arms above you move suddenly as you enter the room, but do not approach you[if the charge of laundry robots > 0]. Maybe they need to recharge[end if].".

Definition: a clothing (called C) is washable:
	if C is cursed or C is locked or C is glued, decide no;
	if C is fluid immune, decide no;
	if the coverer of C is clothing, decide no;
	if C is dirty, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a diaper is washable: decide no.

robo vacuum cleaner is a thing. robo vacuum cleaner is not portable. The printed name of robo vacuum cleaner is "[TQlink of item described]robo vacuum cleaner[TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]". The text-shortcut of robo vacuum cleaner is "rvc".
robo vacuum cleaner has a number called patrol. the patrol of robo vacuum cleaner is 1.
robo vacuum cleaner has a number called puddle-sucks.
robo vacuum cleaner is in Hotel20.
A diaper quest fix rule:
	destroy robo vacuum cleaner.

Figure of vacuum cleaner is the file "Env/Hotel/vacuum1.jpg".
Figure of vacuum cleaner male is the file "Env/Hotel/vacuum2.jpg".
Figure of vacuum cleaner female is the file "Env/Hotel/vacuum3.jpg".

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - robo vacuum cleaner):
	if C is penetrating a fuckhole:
		if the player is possessing a penis, decide on figure of vacuum cleaner male;
		otherwise decide on figure of vacuum cleaner female;
	otherwise:
		decide on figure of vacuum cleaner.

To decide which number is the girth of robo vacuum cleaner: decide on 2.

To say ExamineDesc of (C - robo vacuum cleaner):
	say "A very large robotic vacuum cleaner, with diameter similar to that of a coffee table. At it centre, a dildo on a long vertical pole is secured to the top. Towards the front, a long clear plastic tube emerges from the exhaust port. It would appear that whatever liquids the vacuum cleaner mops and sucks up will be delivered out via this tube[if C is penetrating face], which of course currently has its other end in your mouth[end if].".
