	if inline hyperlinks > 0 and newbie tips is 1, say "[bold type][one of]Do not use a hyperlink here, or this will cause the game to crash. Type a number instead. I have no idea why, sorry.[or]Remember, don't use a hyperlink or the game will crash.[stopping][roman type][line break]".]

Rule for printing a parser error when the latest parser error is the I beg your pardon error:
