Well by Objects begins here.

wishing well is a thing. The printed name of wishing well is "[TQlink of item described]wishing well[TQxlink of item described][shortcut-desc][verb-desc of item described]". The text-shortcut of wishing well is "wiw". wishing well is not portable. wishing well is in Woods27. Figure of well is the file "Env/Forest/well1.png".

wishing well has a number called stored-offerings.

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - wishing well):
	decide on figure of well.
To say ExamineDesc of (C - wishing well):
	say "A deep well. Traditionally, people would throw something valuable down here when making a wish.".

Definition: A wishing well is immune to change: decide yes.

Check inserting something into wishing well:
	try WellWishing the noun instead.

WellWishing is an action applying to one thing.

Check WellWishing:
	unless the location of the player is Woods27, say "You'd probably need a wishing well to do that." instead;
	if the noun is bottle:
		unless the noun is open topped, say "It probably makes more sense to try that with something that has an open top." instead;
		if the doses of the noun < 1, say "But it's empty?" instead;
	otherwise if the noun is not a plentiful accessory:
		unless the noun is infernal gem, say "It probably makes more sense to use something like jewellery." instead;
	[otherwise:
		say "It probably makes more sense to use something like jewellery." instead;]
	if the player is in danger, say "You can't do that in the middle of a fight!" instead.

wellwishes is a number that varies.

Carry out WellWishing:
	[First, we determine what the player is actually wishing for.]
	let wish-type be 0;

	say "What will you wish for?[line break]";
	reset multiple choice questions;

	set next numerical response to "don't make a wish";
	compute multiple choice question;
