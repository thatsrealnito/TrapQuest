Sacred Pool by Objects begins here.

The sacred-pool is a water-body-scenery. the sacred-pool is not portable. The printed name of sacred-pool is "[TQlink of item described]sacred pool[shortcut-desc][TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]". The text-shortcut of sacred-pool is "sap". the sacred-pool has a number called corruption. The sacred-pool is in Mansion25. Understand "sacred", "pool", "sacred pool" as sacred-pool.

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - sacred-pool):
	decide on Figure of mansion pool room.

To say ExamineDesc of (C - sacred-pool):
	say "A [if the corruption of C < 60]crystal clear pool of water[otherwise if the corruption of C < 120]slightly murky pool of water[otherwise]an opaque pool of what might be water[end if], with a statue of a [if pregnancy fetish is 1]heavily pregnant nude[otherwise]robed[end if] woman kneeling at the far edge. Water is flowing from a small basin in the statue's hands, [if the corruption of C < 60]yet the surface of the water is completely undisturbed.[otherwise if the corruption of C < 120]causing tiny waves to propagate across the water's surface.[otherwise]causing disproportionately large waves to propagate across the water's surface.[end if]".

To compute sacred bathing:
	soak body in water body;
	clean makeup in water body;
	clean creampie in water body;
	soak clothing in water body;
	let leech-done be 0;
	let P be sacred-pool;
