Eggs by Collectibles begins here.

An egg is a kind of collectible. An egg can be laid. An egg is usually not laid.
An egg can be shuddering. [Has the player seen it shudder?]

Definition: an egg is insertable: decide yes.

To construct normal icons for (T - an egg):
	now IconTarget is T;
	if T is shuddering, add Figure of HatchingIcon to the list of Icons.

This is the egg stuffing rule:
	if stat-to-set matches the text "egg":
		let BL be belly limit - the total squirtable fill of belly;
		let S be a random small egg;
		if stat-to-set matches the text "small":
			let S be a random carried small egg;
			if S is nothing, let S be a random small egg in the location of the player;
		otherwise if stat-to-set matches the text "medium":
			let S be a random carried medium egg;
			if S is nothing, let S be a random medium egg in the location of the player;
		otherwise if stat-to-set matches the text "large":
			let S be a random carried large egg;
			if S is nothing, let S be a random large egg in the location of the player;
		let remainingN be the number of small eggs in the location of the player;
		let remainingV be remainingN;
		let V be 1;
		if S is small egg:
			increase remainingN by the number of carried small eggs;
		if S is medium egg:
			now remainingN is the number of medium eggs in the location of the player;
			increase remainingN by the number of carried medium eggs;
			now remainingV is remainingN * 2;
			now V is 2;
		if S is large egg:
			now remainingN is the number of large eggs in the location of the player;
			increase remainingN by the number of carried large eggs;
			now remainingV is remainingN * 4;
			now V is 4;
		let T be an indexed text;
		let T be the player's command;
		let N be the numerical value of T;
		if N > 0 and V * N <= BL:
			let N2 be N;
			if S is small egg:
				repeat with E running through carried small eggs:
					if N2 > 0:
						destroy E;
						decrease N2 by 1;
				repeat with E running through small eggs in the location of the player:
					if N2 > 0:
						destroy E;
						decrease N2 by 1;
			if S is medium egg:
				repeat with E running through carried medium eggs:
					if N2 > 0:
						destroy E;
						decrease N2 by 1;
				repeat with E running through medium eggs in the location of the player:
					if N2 > 0:
						destroy E;
						decrease N2 by 1;
			if S is large egg:
				repeat with E running through carried large eggs:
					if N2 > 0:
						destroy E;
						decrease N2 by 1;
				repeat with E running through large eggs in the location of the player:
					if N2 > 0:
						destroy E;
						decrease N2 by 1;
			let F be asshole;
			if stat-to-set matches the text "vagina", now F is vagina;
			allocate 6 seconds;
			if F is vagina, say "Thanks to your cervix already being painfully stretched by its contents, you manage to push [if N > 1][N] more [ShortDesc of S]s[otherwise]another [ShortDesc of S][end if] through it and into your womb.";
			compute insertionRuin of S into F;
			if F is asshole:
				if S is small egg, assfill N small eggs;
				if S is medium egg, assfill N medium eggs;
				if S is large egg, assfill N large eggs;
				now the squirt timer of belly is 0;
			otherwise:
				if S is small egg, wombfill N small eggs;
				if S is medium egg, wombfill N medium eggs;
				if S is large egg, wombfill N large eggs;
		otherwise:
			say "[if N is 0]Action cancelled[otherwise if N <= remainingN]You won't be able to fit that many inside you[otherwise]You don't have that many nearby[end if].";
			reject the player's command;
		now stat-to-set is "";
		change the text of the player's command to "finish setting".
The egg stuffing rule is listed in the statsetting rules.

An egg has a number called hatching.

Check attacking egg:
	if the player is at least partially immobile, say "You're a bit busy!" instead;
	allocate 1 seconds;
	say "The shell is too strong! You can't damage it at all. If you want to get rid of it, perhaps you could [bold type]flush it down a toilet[roman type][line break]" instead.
Check slapping egg:
	try attacking the noun instead.
Check kneeing egg:
	try attacking the noun instead.
Check kicking egg:
	try attacking the noun instead.
Check dropping egg:
	if the location of the player is toilets:
		reset multiple choice questions; [ALWAYS REMEMBER THIS WHEN MAKING A MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION]
		set numerical response 1 to "drop [NameDesc of the noun] on the ground";
		set numerical response 2 to "flush [NameDesc of the noun] down the toilet";
		if the number of carried eggs > 1:
			set numerical response 3 to "drop all your eggs on the ground";
			set numerical response 4 to "flush all your eggs down the toilet";
		set numerical response 0 to "cancel";
		compute multiple choice question;
		if player-numerical-response is 0, say "Action cancelled." instead;
		if the remainder after dividing player-numerical-response by 2 is 0:
			if the player is immobile, say "You're a bit busy!" instead;
			if player-numerical-response is 4:
				repeat with E running through carried eggs:
					unless E is the noun, compute flushing of E;
			compute flushing of the noun instead; [beyond this let the drop action occur normally]
		otherwise if player-numerical-response is 2:
			repeat with E running through carried eggs:
				unless E is the noun, now E is in the location of the player.

Report examining egg when egg laying fetish is 1:
	say "[if the noun is shuddering][bold type]You have seen it move and shudder, suggesting it has been successfully fertilised and incubated. [roman type][end if]The strong shell can't be destroy by brute force, but perhaps you could [bold type]drop[roman type] it down the toilet.".

To compute flushing of (E - a thing):
	allocate 2 seconds;
	destroy E;
	say "You flush [NameDesc of E] down the toilet.".

To uniquely destroy (E - an egg):
	now the hatching of E is 0;
	now E is not shuddering;
	now E is not laid.

A later time based rule (this is the hatchtime rule):
	repeat with E running through on-stage eggs:
		if the hatching of E > 0:
			compute hatchtime of E.

To compute hatchtime of (E - an egg):
	increase the hatching of E by a random number between 1 and 2;
	if E is held or E is in the location of the player:
		if the remainder after dividing the hatching of E by 30 is 0:
			now E is shuddering;
			say "[BigNameDesc of E] shudders[one of]. Is there something alive inside?![or].[stopping]";
			if E is carried, force inventory-focus redraw;
	if the hatching of E > 130 and E is regional:
		compute hatch of E.

To compute hatch of (E - an egg):
	let L be a random off-stage larva;
	if L is larva:
		if E is held or E is in the location of the player, say "[BigNameDesc of E] cracks open, and a maggot-like tentacle larva worms its way out.[one of][line break][variable custom style]Gross![roman type][line break][or][stopping]";
		now L is in the location of E;
		larvaShortcutAssign L;
	otherwise:
		if E is held or E is in the location of the player, say "[BigNameDesc of E] fizzles into nothingness.";
	destroy E.

Definition: a small egg (called D) is available:
	if D is off-stage, decide yes;
	repeat with E running through off-stage small eggs:
		decide no;
	if D is in the location of the player, decide no;
	decide yes.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (E - a small egg):
	decide on 49.

Definition: a medium egg (called D) is available:
	if D is off-stage, decide yes;
	repeat with E running through off-stage medium eggs:
		decide no;
	if D is in the location of the player, decide no;
	decide yes.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (E - a medium egg):
	decide on 24.

Definition: a large egg (called D) is available:
	if D is off-stage, decide yes;
	repeat with E running through off-stage large eggs:
		decide no;
	if D is in the location of the player, decide no;
	decide yes.

To decide which number is the crafting key of (E - a large egg):
	decide on 25.

You watch with [horror] as it rapidly grows in size, until [NameDesc of TM][bold type] is standing in front of you.";

					destroy M.

larvaShortcutCount is initially 1.

	if the text-shortcut of C is "lva":
		now the text-shortcut of C is substituted form of "lva[larvaShortcutCount]";
		increase larvaShortcutCount by 1.
