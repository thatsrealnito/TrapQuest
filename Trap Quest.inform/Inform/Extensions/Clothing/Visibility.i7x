Visibility by Clothing begins here.

Definition: a clothing is layer-concealing: decide yes. [Clothing that is layer-exposing is cut in such a way that a viewer can always see glimpses of the layer underneath. Clothing that is layer-concealing never does this. Clothing that has a special rule should redefine the definition block below. This is about the CUT and SHAPE of the item, and not transparency. Transparency is checked for separately. A see through raincoat would still be layer-concealing.]
Definition: a clothing is partially-layer-concealing:
	if it is layer-concealing, decide yes;
	decide no. [If you want to set this to 'YES' to make something partially layer concealing, you should also set the layer-concealing definition above to 'NO']

	if it is not partially-layer-concealing, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is potentially-top-layer-concealing:
	if C is layer-concealing and C is potentially-partially-top-layer-concealing, decide yes;

	decide no.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is potentially-bottom-layer-concealing:
	if C is layer-concealing and C is potentially-partially-bottom-layer-concealing, decide yes; [crotch-assless clothing doesn't hide what's underneath]
	decide no.
Definition: a clothing (called C) is bottom-layer-concealing:
	if C is worn and C is potentially-bottom-layer-concealing, decide yes;

Definition: a clothing (called C) is potentially-partially-bottom-layer-concealing:
	if C is partially-layer-concealing and C is not-butt-windowed and (C is total protection or C is skirt-covering-crotch), decide yes; [crotch-assless clothing doesn't hide what's underneath, but both 'total protection' and 'skirt-covering-crotch' already check for this]
	decide no.

	if C is worn and C is potentially-partially-bottom-layer-concealing, decide yes;
	decide no.

current-clothing is a thing that varies.

Definition: a thing is currently perceivable:
	if it is currently-not-in-bag or it is currently at least partially visible, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: a thing is currently visible: decide no.

Definition: a wearthing (called C) is currently visible: [Is the item worn and currently completely visible to onlookers?]
	if C is not worn, decide no;

		decide no;
	decide yes.

[Layers, not visibility. Mesh items don't count as covering at all since liquid can get through]
To decide which object is the top-coverer of (C - a clothing):
	if the top-layer of C > 0:
		repeat with O running through top-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the top-layer of O > the top-layer of C and O is not mesh and the cleavageCover of O >= the cleavageCover of C:
				decide on O;
	decide on nothing.

To decide which object is the mid-coverer of (C - a clothing):
	if the mid-layer of C > 0:
		repeat with O running through mid-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the mid-layer of O > the mid-layer of C and O is not mesh:
				decide on O;
	decide on nothing.

To decide which object is the bottom-coverer of (C - a clothing):
	if the bottom-layer of C > 0 or C is chastity bond or C is condom of kings:
		repeat with O running through bottom-layer-concealing clothing:
			if the bottom-layer of O > the bottom-layer of C and O is not mesh:

[Layers, not visibility. We will prioritise a top layer thing over a bottom layer thing. We prioritise a bottom layer thing over a middle layer thing.]
To decide which object is the coverer of (C - a clothing):
	let T be the top-coverer of C;
	let M be the mid-coverer of C;

	if (the top-layer of C > 0 and T is nothing) or (the mid-layer of C > 0 and M is nothing) or (the bottom-layer of C > 0 and B is nothing), decide on nothing;
	if the top-layer of C > 0, decide on T;

	decide on M.

[Layers + visibility]
[We will prioritise a top layer thing over a bottom layer thing. We prioritise a bottom layer thing over a middle layer thing.]
To decide which object is the concealer of (C - a clothing):

		decide on T; [We point at the top coverer over others, because it's the most visible.]
	[Top is irrelevant. Review the outcomes of bottom and middle.]
	if B is a thing, decide on B; [We point at the bottom coverer over the middle coverer, as it's more likely to be important information for how the player is concealing a private part.]
	decide on M; [We point at the middle coverer (if there is no coverer at all because it's an item without a layer, this will resolve to 'nothing').]

To decide which object is the at least partial concealer of (C - a wearthing):
	if appearance-explained is 1 and debugmode > 1, say "Checking at least partial concealer of [C].";
	if C is listed in the armUses of arms, decide on arms;
	if C is clothing and (the top-layer of C > 0 or the mid-layer of C > 0 or the bottom-layer of C > 0): [The main difference between this and the one above, is whether the item is layer concealing or just partially layer concealing]

	decide on the concealer of C. [For non-clothing items there's no difference.]

[This is at what bulk levels the clothing can prevent people from even knowing there's a diaper there]
To decide which number is the diaperHidingLength of (C - a clothing):
	if C is crotch-displaced or C is crotch-unzipped or C is crotch-ripped, decide on -1;

	decide on 4.

Definition: a clothing (called C) is diaper hiding:
	if C is potentially asshole covering potentially-bottom-layer-concealing clothing:
		if the diaperHidingLength of C >= the DQBulk of the player, decide yes;

[Sometimes the diaper covering clothing breaks open at certain levels.]
To decide which number is the defaultDiaperCoveringLength of (C - a clothing):
	if C is skirted, decide on the skirtLength of C;

To decide which number is the diaperCoveringLength of (C - a knickers):

[For diapers, this hides the shape too.]
To decide which object is the concealer of (K - a knickers):
	if water-fountain is penetrating asshole, decide on water-fountain;
	repeat with C running through worn diaper hiding clothing:
		if C is not K and (C is skirted or the bottom-layer of C > the bottom-layer of K), decide on C;
	decide on nothing.

[This hides the wet status of the underwear but not the shape.]
To decide which object is the at least partial concealer of (K - a knickers):
	if water-fountain is penetrating asshole, decide on water-fountain;
	repeat with C running through worn diaper covering clothing:
		[if debugmode > 1, say "considering concealment of [ShortDesc of C].";]
