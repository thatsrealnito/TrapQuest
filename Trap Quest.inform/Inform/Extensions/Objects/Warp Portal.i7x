Warp Portal by Objects begins here.

A warp portal is a kind of thing. A warp portal is not portable. The text-shortcut of warp portal is "wpo". Understand "lever" as a warp portal.
A warp portal has a region called destination. The destination of a warp portal is the dungeon.
A warp portal can be next-portal-forbidden. [The player can't use this portal until they use a different one.]
The printed name of a warp portal is "[TQlink of item described]warp portal[TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]".

hotel portal is a warp portal. hotel portal is in Hotel40.
dungeon portal is a warp portal. dungeon portal is in Dungeon10.
mansion portal is a warp portal. mansion portal is in Mansion32.
school portal is a warp portal. school portal is in School01.

A time based rule (this is the flag dungeon portal as accessible rule):
	if the destination of dungeon portal is dungeon:
		if the location of hotel portal is discovered:
			now the destination of dungeon portal is hotel;
		otherwise if the location of mansion portal is discovered:
			now the destination of dungeon portal is mansion.

[Figure of flexible warp portal is the file "Env/MultiFloor/portal1.png".]
Figure of warp portal is the file "Env/MultiFloor/portal1.jpg".

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - a warp portal):
	decide on figure of warp portal.

To decide which direction is the covered-direction of (C - a warp portal):
	decide on north.

To say ExamineDesc of (C - a warp portal):
	say "This giant swirling green portal in the [covered-direction of C] wall will teleport you to another part of the world[if C is next-portal-forbidden]. Or rather it usually would, but right now this one won't be able to take you anywhere - it's glitching wildly! [bold type]You'll need to go find and use another portal in another region of the world first.[roman type][line break][otherwise].[end if]".

Definition: a warp portal is immune to change: decide yes.

Check entering a warp portal:
	try going the covered-direction of the noun instead.

Check pulling a warp portal:
	try turning the noun instead.

[increase the chance of a team predicament by sending a student down if available from the hallway]
Report going south when the player is in School01:
	let ST be a random student in School02;
	if the number of students in School01 is 0 and ST is student:
		try ST going south.

To say unique-verb-desc of (T - a warp portal):
	if inline hyperlinks >= 2 and the text-shortcut of T is not "", say " [link][bracket]enter[close bracket][as]enter [text-shortcut of T][end link] [link][bracket]switch[close bracket][as]pull lever[end link]".

The can't go that way rule is not listed in the check going rulebook.

Check an actor going (this is the can't go that way except for warp portals rule):
	if the room gone to is nothing or the room gone to is Solid Rock:
		if the noun is down, try foodlisting instead;
		if the door gone through is nothing:
			let WP be a random warp portal in the location of the player;
			if WP is warp portal and the covered-direction of WP is the noun and (WP is not regionally in the destination of WP or the destination of WP is school):
				if WP is next-portal-forbidden:
					if the actor is the player:
						say "This portal seems to currently be on the fritz - it's glitching wildly! [We] [can't go] that way.";
					stop the action;
				otherwise if the class of the player is trick-or-treater:
					if the actor is the player:
						say "Your [random worn headgear] is somehow preventing [us] from leaving while [we][']re a [']trick or treater[']!";
					stop the action;
			otherwise:
				if the actor is the player:
					say "[We] [can't go] that way." (A);
				stop the action;
		otherwise:
			if the actor is the player:
				say "[We] [can't], since [the door gone through] [lead] nowhere." (B);
			stop the action.

To decide which direction is the covered-direction of (C - school portal):
	decide on south.

predicamentJustDone is initially true. [We only want one 'extra credit' predicament between each lesson.]
predicamentSavedMakeUp is a number that varies.

To set up predicament clothing for (P - a predicament):
	repeat with C running through on-stage wearthings:
