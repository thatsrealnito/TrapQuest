Offering it to is an action applying to two things.

Check offering it to:
	if the second noun is bag of holding, try BagFeeding the noun to the second noun instead;
	if the second noun is not monster, say "You can only offer things to other people." instead;
	if the second noun is penetrating a body part or the second noun is grabbing the player, say "It's a bit late for that, don't you think?" instead;
	if the noun is body part, try presenting the noun instead;
	if the second noun is rejecting the noun, say "You already tried that, and [he of the second noun] wasn't interested." instead;
	if the noun is not portable, say "That's not something you can give." instead;
	if the noun is diaper and the second noun is witch, try giving the noun to the second noun instead;
	if the noun is worn and the noun is not autoremovable, say "You'd need to remove it first." instead;
	if the second noun is uninterested, say "The [second noun] doesn't seem to be paying attention to you." instead;
	if the second noun is mechanic and the woman-status of woman-player is 91 and the mechanic-scene of woman-player <= 3 and woman-player is in the location of the player and mechanic is unfriendly, say "[big he of mechanic] doesn't seem interested in counter-offers." instead;
	if the second noun is wench and the second noun is dangerous and the noun is desirable knickers and the second noun is not horny-wench:
		allocate 4 seconds;
		compute the second noun WenchReceiving the noun instead;
		do nothing instead. [Weird bug where the above command doesn't do the "instead" bit.]

Carry out offering it to:
	allocate 6 seconds;
	now convincing power is 0;
	say OfferFlav of the noun;
	increase convincing power by the bartering value of the noun for the second noun;
	if convincing power > 0:
		increase convincing power by ((the charisma of the player * 4) scaled) / 4; [makes it slightly more logarithmic]
	if convincing power > 10, now convincing power is 10;
	compute the second noun considering the noun.

Understand "offer [something] to [something]", "trade [something] with [something]" as offering it to.

	if the player is able to speak:

		say "[variable custom style][muffled sounds][roman type][line break]";
	otherwise:
		say "You hold the item up to the [second noun].".
