Things Framework by Objects begins here.

A thing has an indexed text called a text-shortcut. Understand the text-shortcut property as describing a thing.

Part - Price and Ownership

A thing can be unowned, store, museum-store, stolen, museum-stolen (this is the ownership property). A thing is usually unowned.

To say ownership-desc of (T - a thing):
	if the item described is stolen or the item described is museum-stolen, say "[roman type] (stolen)";
	if the item described is store and the location of the player is not Mansion28, say "[roman type] ([if T is in Dungeon41 or the player is in Dungeon41]for sale - [price of item described][otherwise]cleverly stolen - please report bug[end if])".

To decide what number is the original price of (C - a thing):
	decide on 0.

To decide what number is the price of (C - a thing):
	let X be the original price of C;
	if discount > 0, decrease X by 5;
	if the blue-balls of shopkeeper < 0, decrease X by 1;
	if X < 1, now X is 1;
	decide on X.

To decide what number is the original price of (C - a clothing):
	let X be 3 - ((the initial outrage of C) / 4);
	if C is layer-concealing and (C is dense or C is sheer-when-wet):
		if C is potentially-top-layer-concealing:
			if C is normally-nipple-covering or C is erect-nipple-exposing:
				increase X by 1;
				if C is dense, increase X by 1;
				if C is normally-nipple-covering, increase X by 1;
				if C is average cut or higher, increase X by 1;
				if C is fully covering, increase X by 1;
		if C is potentially-bottom-layer-concealing:
			increase X by 2;
			if C is knee-length or C is slitted, increase X by 1;
		otherwise if C is potentially-partially-bottom-layer-concealing:
			increase X by 1;
	otherwise:
		if C is total protection:
			increase X by 2;
		otherwise if C is pussy protection:
			increase X by 1;
	if C is rare, increase X by 2;
	decide on X.

To decide what number is the price of (C - a clothing):
	let X be the original price of C;
	if C is trousers:
		now X is 9;
	if C is skirt:
		now X is 4;
	if C is accessory:
		if C is not plentiful, decide on 0;
		if C is ring, now X is 1;
		if C is bracelet, now X is 2;
		if C is necklace, now X is 4;
		if C is sapphire, now X is X * 1;
		if C is emerald, now X is X * 2;
		if C is ruby, now X is X * 3;
		if C is pink diamond, now X is X * 4;
		if C is pure diamond, now X is X * 5;

	otherwise:
		increase X by the magic-modifier of C;
		if C is not blandness, increase X by 1;
		if discount > 0, decrease X by 5;
		if the blue-balls of shopkeeper < 0, decrease X by 1;
		if X < 1, now X is 1;
	decide on X.

A thing has a number called tradability.

A game universe initialisation rule:
	repeat with T running through things:
		if the tradability of T is 0, now the tradability of T is the price of T.

[!<discount:Integer>*

The shopkeeper can give the player a discount. This number tracks how many seconds are left on the discount. If the number is -1, this means that the discount will not be offered again. This happens when the discount offer is refused.

*!]
discount is a number that varies. discount is 0.

To decide which number is the total wealth of the player:
	let X be 0;
	repeat with A running through plentiful accessories held by the player:
		increase X by the price of A;
	decide on X.

To decide which number is the wealth of the player:
	let X be 0;
	repeat with A running through worn accessories:
		increase X by the price of A;
	decide on X.

Part - Titles and Images

[This overrides whatever other image we were going to display for the thing, once only.]
A thing has a figure-name called the temporary-image. The temporary-image of a thing is usually figure of no-image-yet.
A thing has a figure-name called the previous-temporary-image. The previous-temporary-image of a thing is usually figure of no-image-yet. [We want to know what we just pushed to the focus window in case the player asks us to blow it up onto the map window.]

A thing has a number called backgroundColour. The backgroundColour of a thing is usually -1. [If this is a positive number, it is used to render a full body of colour behind the image.]
To update background colour of (T - a thing):
	do nothing.

To decide which figure-name is the next-examine-image of (C - a thing):
	if the temporary-image of C is not figure of no-image-yet, decide on the temporary-image of C;
	decide on the examine-image of C.

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - a thing):
	decide on figure of no-image-yet.

To maybe-map-display (C - a thing):
	if images visible is 1:
		let F be the examine-image of C;
		if previous-temporary-image of C is not figure of no-image-yet, now F is previous-temporary-image of C;
		if the focus-window is g-present: [We're not going to display in the main window. So instead let's display a zoomed in version in the map window.]
			if the map-window is g-present:
				update background colour of C;
				MapShow F with background (backgroundColour of C);
				if seconds is 0, display entire map; [This isn't going to happen automatically because time hasn't moved forward. So we prompt it ourselves.]
				otherwise now map-turn-stall is 1; [If we didn't do this, the temporary-map-figure would be reset before it has a chance to be shown properly, when the time progression is calculated (towards the bottom of "to run the engine once" in Compute Turn.i7x.]
			otherwise:
				cutshow F for C;
		otherwise:
			display F.

	otherwise if diaper quest is 1 and the cringe of C / 2 is too humiliating:
		say "This is way too childish for me to be carrying around like this where it's completely on display!";
	otherwise if the outrage of C / 2 is too humiliating:
		say "I can't believe I am carrying this around with me where everyone can see it. How awful!";
	otherwise if (the cringe of C / 2) - 2 is too humiliating or (the outrage of C / 2) - 2 is too humiliating:
		say "I really would prefer to not be carrying around something this humiliating.";
	otherwise:
		say "I guess I should find this a bit embarrassing to carry around where everyone can see it, but I just don't.";
	if debuginfo > 0, say "[line break][input-style]Held visible item outrage: [outrage of C / 2] / 10[if diaper quest is 1]; childishness: [cringe of C / 2] / 10[end if].";

To cutshow (F - a figure-name) for (M - a thing):
	unless F is figure of no-image-yet:
		if image cutscenes > 1:
			alwayscutshow F for M;

			display F.

		otherwise if image cutscenes > 0: [The player has requested cutscenes and has the focus window disabled.]

Part - Other

Definition: a thing is disembodied rather than embodied: decide no. [When penetrating an orifice, can it fit underneath other clothing like a sex toy? Or will clothing get in the way, e.g. a dildo pole?]
