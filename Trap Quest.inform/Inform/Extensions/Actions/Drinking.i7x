autodrink is a number that varies.
drinking-target is an object that varies.

The global drinkability rules is a rulebook.
The default drinkability rules is a rulebook.
A bottle has a rulebook called drinkability rules. The drinkability rules of a bottle is usually the default drinkability rules.

Definition: a bottle (called B) is actually drinkable:
	now drinking-target is B;
	follow the drinkability rules of B;
	if the rule failed:
		now drinking-target is nothing;
		decide no;
	follow the global drinkability rules;
	if the rule failed:
		now drinking-target is nothing;
		decide no;
	now drinking-target is nothing;
	decide yes.

Definition: yourself is resisting taste addiction:
	if the player is taste obsessed:
		if drinking-target is bottle:
			if debugmode > 0, say "[input-style]Fill colour of [MediumDesc of drinking-target] is [fill-colour of drinking-target].[roman type][line break]";
			if ((the fill-colour of drinking-target is creamy and semen is highest addicted liquid) or (the fill-colour of drinking-target is golden and urine is highest addicted liquid) or (the fill-colour of drinking-target is white and milk is highest addicted liquid)), decide no;
		if drinking-target is DungeonScenery01 and semen is highest addicted liquid, decide no;
		if drinking-target is breasts and milk is highest addicted liquid, decide no;
		decide yes;
	decide no.

This is the addicts refuse to drink other liquids rule:
	if the player is resisting taste addiction:
		if autodrink is 0:
			if the player is taste engulfed:
				say OnlyDrinksSemen;

The addicts refuse to drink other liquids rule is listed last in the global drinkability rules.

This is the just use your mouth to drink rule:
	if drinking-target is carried and (the player is not able to use their hands or the player is wrist bound behind):
		if autodrink is 0, say "Since you don't have the use of your hands, you're going to have to put that on the ground[if the player is upright] and kneel down[end if] if you want to drink it.";
		rule fails.
The just use your mouth to drink rule is listed in the global drinkability rules.

This is the empty bottles can't be drunk rule:
	if drinking-target is empty bottle:

		otherwise:
			say "You're going to have to kneel down if you want to drink that." instead;
	if the noun is not held, do nothing instead; [We need to double check that the player still has the drink. The Drink Me Tattoo, for example, could cause it to have already been consumed during the above 'compute extra turn' function.]
	if autodrink is 0 and the player is overly full and the stomach-water of the player > 2:
		say "You are already feeling very full. Are you sure you want to force even more down (you will have a significantly reduced chance of gaining positive effects)? ";

				if autodrink is 0, say "You manage to stretch your [LipDesc] wide enough to get some past your [ShortDesc of T].";
			otherwise if autodrink is 0:

	allocate 2 seconds;
	say "You try tasting it. Ugh, it tastes horrible! That is definitely not good for you. You [if the thirst of the player < 5]would rather faint[otherwise]stop[end if]." instead.

Carry out drinking water-body:
	say "You place your lips in the water and sip. It tastes healthy enough[if the thirst of the player > 2] and quenches your thirst[end if].";
	allocate 6 seconds;
	StomachUp 2;

	DoseDown the noun;
	if the doses of the noun is 0, say "[BigNameDesc of the noun] is now empty.".


tasteAddictionPenaltyTime is a number that varies.

To decide which number is TasteAddictionCooldown:
	decide on 300.

Report drinking:
	if the player is resisting taste addiction, compute taste addiction resist punishment.

To compute taste addiction resist punishment:
	increase tasteAddictionPenaltyTime by TasteAddictionCooldown;
	say "[bold type]Drinking something other than [AddictedFluids] is making you feel very low! [roman type]Your intelligence will be reduced for [if tasteAddictionPenaltyTime > TasteAddictionCooldown]a few minutes more, and by even more than before[otherwise]a few minutes[end if]".


An all time based rule (this is the taste addiction penalty cooldown rule):
	if tasteAddictionPenaltyTime > 0 and the player is not in a predicament room:
		let pTA be the remainder after dividing tasteAddictionPenaltyTime by TasteAddictionCooldown;
		decrease tasteAddictionPenaltyTime by time-seconds;
		if pTA <= time-seconds:
			say "[bold type]Your intelligence has [if tasteAddictionPenaltyTime > 0]partially [end if]recovered from feeling low after failing to follow your [AddictedFluids] diet.[roman type][line break]";
			if tasteAddictionPenaltyTime < 0, now tasteAddictionPenaltyTime is 0;



Report drinking a vessel:

Feeling your own nipple stiffen with arousal, so it pokes into the soft flesh of your lips, sends a humiliating surge of excitement straight to your groin. You can't resist flicking the erect bud with your tongue, and even gently biting on it as you suck. Or [i]suckle[/i], really. You flush with the knowledge that you're both lactating and drinking yourself, like some hot, slutty babe in a porno, and a curious thrill of shame ripples through you at the thought of what your friends would think if they could see you now. [if the player is possessing a penis and the size of penis < 3]You burn with hot shame as your tongue tells you your [i]nipple[/i] is now bigger than your [PenisFlavour real size of penis]!
