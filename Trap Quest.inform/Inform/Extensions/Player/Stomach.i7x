Stomach by Player begins here.

To decide which number is the stomach-liquid of the player:
	decide on the stomach-water of the player + the stomach-semen of the player + the stomach-milk of the player + the stomach-urine of the player.

To decide which number is the stomach of the player:
	decide on the stomach-liquid of the player + the stomach-food of the player.

To decide which number is stomach-max:
	decide on 14.

Definition: yourself is overly full:
	if the stomach of the player > stomach-max, decide yes;
	decide no.

Definition: yourself is almost too full:
	if the stomach of the player is stomach-max or the stomach of the player is stomach-max - 1, decide yes;
	decide no.

old-fullness-bonus is a number that varies.

To decide which number is fullness-bonus:
	if diaper quest is 0 or diaper messing < 3 or the number of worn soilable knickers is 0 or the stomach of the player + 1 < stomach-max, decide on 0;
	decide on potential-fullness-bonus.

To decide which number is potential-fullness-bonus:
	if the stomach-food of the player > 4, decide on 3; [we don't want this to be too crazy]
	decide on (the stomach-food of the player + 1) / 2.

An all later time based rule (this is the satiated causes bonus strength rule):
	let F be fullness-bonus;
	if F > old-fullness-bonus:

		otherwise say "[bold type]As the amount of food digesting in your well-satisfied stomach increases, you feel your strength continue to improve[one of] as well[or][stopping]![roman type][line break]";
		now old-fullness-bonus is F;
	otherwise if F < old-fullness-bonus:
		if F > 0:
			say "As your stomach digests some of its food contents, your bonus strength decreases.";
		otherwise if potential-fullness-bonus is 0:
			say "Now that your stomach has digested most of its food contents, your bonus strength has disappeared.";
		otherwise if the player is not almost too full:
			say "Now that you feel less full, your bonus strength has disappeared.";
		otherwise:
			say "Now that you are not wearing [if diaper messing >= 5]underwear[otherwise]a diaper[end if], your bonus strength from feeling full has disappeared.";
		now old-fullness-bonus is F.
