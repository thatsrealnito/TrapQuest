A lake monster is a kind of person. A lake monster is usually unintelligent. There is 1 lake monster. The printed name of lake monster is usually "[TQlink of item described][input-style]lake monster[roman type][shortcut-desc][TQxlink of item described][verb-desc of item described]". The text-shortcut of lake monster is "lm". A lake monster has a number called semen-sniffing. A lake monster is not portable. A lake monster can be lake-stalking or not lake-stalking. A lake monster is usually not lake-stalking. A lake monster has a number called swim-location. The swim-location of lake monster is usually 5.

Definition: a lake monster is icon-enabled: decide no. [Do they need an icon on the map?]
Definition: a lake monster is father material: decide yes.
Definition: A lake monster is live: decide yes.

To decide which number is the girth of (M - a lake monster):
	decide on 10.

A time based rule (this is the lake monster gets bored rule):
	if the semen-sniffing of a random lake monster > 0:
		let L be a random lake monster;
		decrease the semen-sniffing of L by seconds / 2;
		if the semen-sniffing of L <= 0:
			now the semen-sniffing of L is 0;
			if the player is in the location of L, say "The [L]'s tentacles recede into the water. You watch as the large shadow of the [L] travels away from you, back to the far reaches of the lake. Maybe it's safe to wash in here again now?";
			remove L from play;

To decide which figure-name is the examine-image of (C - a lake monster):
	decide on figure of lake monster.

To say ExamineDesc of (C - a lake monster):
	say "You can just about make out the huge shadow of its main body deep beneath the surface, but the only properly visible parts are the strong and seemingly intelligent tentacles that are rising proudly from the water's murky depths.".

To say PregGrowth of (M - a lake monster):
	say "the lake monster's [one of]spawn[or][child][or]babies[as decreasingly likely outcomes]".

[0 = Nothing, 1 = One waiting in front, 2 = One using for sex, 3 = Both 1 and 2, 4 = DP]
A lake monster has a number called m-state.
A lake monster has a number called a-state.
A lake monster has a number called p-state.
A lake monster has a number called b-state.

[
The player can swim to the deeper areas of the lake to look for treasure.

however, each turn the player spends there will make the monster that much more likely to notice them.

Every turn, there's a chance the player will see a treasure glint, and they can dive to get the treasure. But, there's also a chance of being noticed by the monster.

When the monster is stalking the player, it is invisible until the player has specifically noticed it. The only sign is that the player will always see a "treasure" glint, which is really the monster waiting silently for their chance (which a dive turns into a sure thing).

After the player notices the monster, it becomes a chase. The player can no longer dive, and the monster will attempt to grab them. The monster can't get to the most shallow area, but it can still grab the player when they're there.
